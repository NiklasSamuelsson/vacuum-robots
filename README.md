# Vacuum Robots
A learning project for C++ of a simple enivironment with a vacuum robot and a reinforcement learning agent controlling it.
- The robot has to visit all squares in a 2D grid to finish the task
- The robot can only travel to adjacent squares (not diagonally) or idle
- The reward function is a cost of 1 each time step being passed
- The agent controlling the robot is a basic Q-learning agent
